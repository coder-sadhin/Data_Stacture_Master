"""
- A linked list is similar to an array, it holds values. However, links in a linked
    list do not have indexes.
- This is an example of a double ended, doubly linked list.
- Each link references the next link and the previous one.
- A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous
    pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.
 - Advantages over SLL - It can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
     Delete operation is more efficient
