Calculate the Product Sum from a Special Array.

Python doctests can be run with the following command:
python -m doctest -v product_sum.py

Calculate the product sum of a "special" array which can contain integers or nested
arrays. The product sum is obtained by adding all elements and multiplying by their
respective depths.

For example, in the array [x, y], the product sum is (x + y). In the array [x, [y, z]],
the product sum is x + 2 * (y + z). In the array [x, [y, [z]]],
the product sum is x + 2 * (y + 3z).

Example Input:
[5, 2, [-7, 1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]
Output: 12
