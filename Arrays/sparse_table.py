"""
Sparse table is a data structure that allows answering range queries on
a static number list, i.e. the elements do not change throughout all the queries.

The implementation below will solve the problem of Range Minimum Query:
Finding the minimum value of a subset [L..R] of a static number list.

Overall time complexity: O(nlogn)
Overall space complexity: O(nlogn)
